# pre-commit-script by gidra
## Prerequisites
  - Gitleaks
## Installation 
 1. Open a terminal and navigate to your Git repository's local directory.

 2. Create a new file named pre-commit in the .git/hooks directory:
 ```bash
 sudo nano .git/hooks/pre-commit
 ```
 3. Open the pre-commit file in a text editor and add the following content:

 ```bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

output=$(gitleaks detect --verbose --redact)

if [[ -n $output ]]; then
    echo "Error: Secrets found in the code:"
    echo "$output"
    exit 1
fi
```
 4. Save the file and exit the text editor.

 5. Make the pre-commit file executable:

```bash
Copy code
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
Now, whenever you attempt to make a commit, the pre-commit hook will automatically run gitleaks to check for secrets in your code. If any secrets are detected, the commit will be rejected, and an error message will be displayed.
